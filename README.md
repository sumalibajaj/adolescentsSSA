This repository has code and data downloaded from [World Population Prospects 2022](https://population.un.org/dataportal/home) for estimating the following:

1. Number of adolescent mothers in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in 2023 (`adolescent_mothers_current.R`, `unpopulation_dataportal_20230817160939.csv`, `unpopulation_dataportal_20230817164255.csv`) = **14,984,277**  
   Out of **64,177,796** adolescent women in 2023
2. Projection of number of adolescents in SSA in 2030 (`adolescent_projections.R`, `unpopulation_dataportal_20230817144903.csv`) = **321,444,348**
3. 2022 estimate of 10-17 year olds in SSA = **35 (or 34) million**
4. 2023 population of 0-19 year olds (inclusive) in Africa is **735 million**, 2030 = **825 million**, 2050 = **1.023 billion**


### Notes:
